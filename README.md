# Cuffless blood pressure estimation

This project consists of a convolutional neural network regressor to estimate blood pressure use PPG recordings. For detailed information see [report pdf](https://github.com/rohitrathnam/cuffless-bp/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%20-%20Rohit%20Rathnam%20N.pdf).

Input - Spectrogram of PPG signal

Output - Systolic BP, Diastolic BP

Data source - [MIMIC II database](https://archive.physionet.org/mimic2/)
